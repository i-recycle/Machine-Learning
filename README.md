## About the Project
i-recycle is an application that can detect types of waste and provide education to the public about waste. This application can help you to be able to contribute in saving the earth by recycling the garbage that we have at home. Garbage can also be turned into valuable and reusable items. We use Convolutional Neural Network for image classification. To improve our machine learning model we use transfer learning. We chose to use a pre-trained model for image classification, namely InceptionV3.

## Dataset
In this project we use a dataset from Kaggle which contains images of garbage divided into 12 classes to classify the types of waste.
